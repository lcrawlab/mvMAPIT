Description: Epistasis, commonly defined as the interaction between genetic loci, is known to play an important role in
  the phenotypic variation of complex traits. As a result, many statistical methods have been developed to identify
  genetic variants that are involved in epistasis, and nearly all of these approaches carry out this task by focusing on
  analyzing one trait at a time. Previous studies have shown that jointly modeling multiple phenotypes can often
  dramatically increase statistical power for association mapping. In this study, we present the
  'multivariate MArginal ePIstasis Test' (mvMAPIT) – a multi-outcome generalization of a recently proposed epistatic
  detection method which seeks to detect marginal epistasis or the combined pairwise interaction effects
  between a given variant and all other variants. By searching for marginal epistatic effects, one can identify genetic
  variants that are involved in epistasis without the need to identify the exact partners with which the variants
  interact – thus, potentially alleviating much of the statistical and computational burden associated with
  conventional explicit search based methods. Our proposed mvMAPIT builds upon this strategy by taking of correlation
  structures between traits to improve the identification of variants involved in epistasis. We formulate mvMAPIT as a
  multivariate linear mixed model and develop a multi-trait variance component estimation algorithm for efficient
  parameter inference and P-value computation. Together with reasonable model approximations, our proposed approach is
  scalable to moderately sized GWA studies.
