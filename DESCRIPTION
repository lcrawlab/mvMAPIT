Description: Multivariate analysis of pairwise epistatic contributions to
    genetic architecture in quantitative traits.
    Epistasis, commonly defined as the interaction between
    multiple genes, is an important genetic component underlying
    phenotypic variation. Many statistical methods have been developed to
    model and identify epistatic interactions between genetic variants.
    However, because of the large combinatorial search space of
    interactions, most epistasis mapping methods face enormous
    computational challenges and often suffer from low statistical power.
    In Crawford et al. (2017), we present a novel, alternative strategy
    for mapping epistasis: the MArginal ePIstasis Test (MAPIT). Our method
    examines one variant at a time, and estimates and tests its "marginal
    epistatic effects" --- the combined pairwise interaction effects
    between a given variant and all other variants. By avoiding explicitly
    searching for interactions, our method avoids the large combinatorial
    search space and improves power. Our method is novel and relies on a
    recently developed variance component estimation method for efficient
    and robust parameter inference and p-value computation.
